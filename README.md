# VISUALIZATION-FOR-SOLVING-NON-IMAGE-PROBLEMS-AND-SALIENCY-MAPPING

 This paper is to explore the efficiency of a new algorithm to convert non-images into images by visualizing data using heatmap in the collocated paired coordinates (CPC). 
 This algorithm is denoted as \textbf{CPC-R}. 
 Powerful deep learning methods open an opportunity to solve non- image ML/DM problems by transforming non-image ML problems into image recognition. 
 The main idea behind CPC-R is splitting attributes of an n-D point into consecutive pairs of its attributes, locating pairs in the same 2-D Cartesian space, and assigning grey scale intensities or colors to the pairs. 
 This paper reports the results of computational experiments with CPC-R algorithm for different CNN architectures, and the methods to optimize the CPC-R images. 
 These results show the combined CPC-R and CNN algorithms which are capable of solving non-image Machine Learning problems.
 Also generates a saliency map that predicts which regions of the image will most likely draw a human viewer's attention.
 
The goal for performing this experiments is to improve the images for humanvisual analysis and improve the deep learning CNN algorithms results.  
Multiple experiments have been conducted to explore the impact of combinations ofproperties of images on accuracy of classification.

Software Discription:
This program was coded as an Python Programming Language version Python 3.7.0. Downloaded the python from anaconda distribution and installed many libraries in anaconda Prompt. Used Spyder IDE and Jupyter Notebook which is an open source software for above experiments. The code that trains and tests a machine learning model with Keras backed by Tensor-Flow in Python. The code is written in python and will be tested in CPU and GPU using the Knuth machine. Keras is an open source neural network library that is written in python.Here the keras will work over the Tensor Flow. TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. Tensor Flow is the back end engine which is recommended usually among the other back end engines.The experiments run on Knuth High Performance Computer machine by using the necessary commands. It uses the Ionosphere, glass and car datasets taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository\cite{asuncion2007uci}. The Python code can be made available on GITHUB.
