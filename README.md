# VISUALIZATION-FOR-SOLVING-NON-IMAGE-PROBLEMS-AND-SALIENCY-MAPPING

 This paper is to explore the efficiency of a new algorithm to convert non-images into images by visualizing data using heatmap in the collocated paired coordinates (CPC). 
 This algorithm is denoted as \textbf{CPC-R}. 
 Powerful deep learning methods open an opportunity to solve non- image ML/DM problems by transforming non-image ML problems into image recognition. 
 The main idea behind CPC-R is splitting attributes of an n-D point into consecutive pairs of its attributes, locating pairs in the same 2-D Cartesian space, and assigning grey scale intensities or colors to the pairs. 
 This paper reports the results of computational experiments with CPC-R algorithm for different CNN architectures, and the methods to optimize the CPC-R images. 
 These results show the combined CPC-R and CNN algorithms which are capable of solving non-image Machine Learning problems.
 Also generates a saliency map that predicts which regions of the image will most likely draw a human viewer's attention.
 
The goal for performing this experiments is to improve the images for humanvisual analysis and improve the deep learning CNN algorithms results.  
Multiple experiments have been conducted to explore the impact of combinations ofproperties of images on accuracy of classification.

Software Discription:
This program was coded as an Python programming language version Python 3.7.0. 
Used Spyder IDE and Jupyter Notebook which is an open source software for above experiments. 
It uses the Ionosphere, glass and car datasets taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository\cite{asuncion2007uci}.
